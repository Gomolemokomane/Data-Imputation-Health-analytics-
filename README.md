# Data-Imputation-Health-analytics 

## Project Overview
This Project outlines the analysis of air pollutant data for the Sebokeng area from January 2011 to February 2020.The datasets were downloaded from the South African Air Quality Information System (Saaqis (environment.gov.za)) under the Department of Forestry and Fisheries Environment, (DFFE).
Missing values were present across all variables and thus the analysis will be done by addressing the missing data through imputation. The datasets were incomplete and required cleaning, we will be using a multivariate method of imputation on the ‘Sebokeng_data’ dataset to handle the missing values.
The dataset and Pollutants will be plotted as a time series before and after imputation. This will allow for a better understanding of the environment and health conditions in Sebokeng. 

## Objective 
Demostrate handling of Missing data Through imputation.
Visualisation : Timeseries before and after imputation.

## Tech Stacks and Tools 
**Programming : Python (pandas,NumPy,Scitkit-learn,Matplotlib)
**Data Visualisation : Matplotlib
**Machine Learning :Scikit-Learn (MICE) 

## Data variables 
The dataset contains five variables which are important for evaluating the air quality and thus the environmental and health conditions in Sebokeng.

## Data cleaning 
The dataset was incomplete and contained several missing values. The dataset was cleaned by removing or dropping rows with all values missing. Missing values could interfere with the identification of trends and the assessment of health risks in Sebokeng

## Key Insights 
MICE capture more complex relationships in the data.
The Timeseries indicates that the imputation process effectively filled in the missing data while maintaining the integrity and continuity of the original time series patterns.
